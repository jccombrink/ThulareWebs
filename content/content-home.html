			<h6>Thulare means to save in a time of abundance so that you have enough in a time of hardship.</h6>
			<h6>Thulare was an African king that taught his nation to lay aside the extra grain in the good years for the harder years to come.</h6>
			<h6>Thulare Hunting Safaris aims to also then save for the future, to hunt selectively and keep the best genes going forward.</h6>
			<h6>Thulare Safaris operates in a malaria free area near Burgersfort in the Limpopo province.</h6>
			<br>
			<h6>The farm is 10 000 acres of magnificent bushveld and is well known for its excellent quality of Kudu, Njala and Mountain Reedbuck to name a few.</h6>
			<br>
			<h6>Once you and your proffesional hunting guide are stalking the trophy of a lifetime, you will feel your heart pounding and find yourself becoming part of the ancient rythm of Africa</h6>
			<br>
			<h6>Our camp is a four hour drive north of the Oliver Tambo International Airport and are about 100 miles from the well known Kruger National Park.</h6>
